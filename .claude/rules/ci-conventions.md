# CI and pre-commit conventions

Applies to every workflow in `.github/workflows/` and to
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Two goals, in this order: **a reader understands the
run at a glance**, and **we do not pay CI minutes for what a laptop can prove**.

## 1. Where a check belongs

| Prove it… | …here | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Formatting, lint, types, file budget, complexity, dead code, duplication, docstrings, typos, unit tests, secrets in the diff, `terraform fmt`, workflow syntax | **pre-commit** (`pre-commit install`) | instant feedback, zero CI cost |
| Full `make gate` including the DB-backed suite | **pre-push** hook | catches it before it ever reaches a runner |
| The same checks on a clean machine, integration tests against a real PostgreSQL, container build + CVE scan, secret scan over the **full history**, dependency CVEs | **CI** | a laptop cannot guarantee these |
| Anything slow, scheduled or org-wide (weekly scans, SBOM) | **scheduled workflow** | keeps the PR path fast |

A new check is added to pre-commit **first**. It goes to CI only if it needs
something the developer's machine cannot provide, or if it must be proven on a
clean checkout.

## 2. Naming contract

- **Workflow file**: `<area>-ci.yaml` (`backend-ci`, `infra-ci`), plus purpose-named ones (`scheduled-scan`).
- **Job name**: `"<Area> · <what it proves>"` — *what it proves*, never the tool list.
  `"Tests · pytest with 100% branch coverage on PostgreSQL 16"`, not `"pytest"`.
- **Step name**: `"<Verb> <object> (<tool>)"` — imperative verb, the object in plain words, the tool in parentheses.
  `"Audit the locked runtime dependencies for CVEs (pip-audit)"`, not `"py.audit"` or `"Run make audit"`.
- Every job ends in a `Report · …` job that writes a table to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, so the run is readable without opening a log.
- Never leave a bare `- uses:` without a `name:`.

## 3. Cost rules

- `concurrency: cancel-in-progress` on every workflow, keyed by ref.
- `paths:` filters so a docs-only change does not start a build.
- `timeout-minutes` on every job (no runaway runners).
- Expensive jobs (`image`, deploy) declare `needs:` on the cheap ones — a branch that fails lint never pays for a build.
- Cache the dependency install (`setup-uv` with `cache-dependency-glob`), use `cache-from/to: type=gha` for Docker layers.
- Prefer a **service container** over starting containers inside the job (testcontainers) when CI supports it.
- Artifacts get an explicit `retention-days` (14 for coverage, 90 for security evidence).
- Pin every action to a released tag and every tool image to a version — a floating tag is both a supply-chain risk and a cache miss.

## 4. Quality gates the project keeps

`make gate` == pre-push == CI, in this order: `lint` (ruff check + format),
`typecheck` (basedpyright strict), `budget` (150 lines), `quality`
(xenon complexity · vulture dead code · interrogate 100 % docstrings · deptry
dependency hygiene · pylint duplication and design limits · codespell), `test`
(pytest, 100 % branch coverage), `audit` (pip-audit). Thresholds live in
`backend/pyproject.toml`; they go **up**, never down, and never in a feature PR.

## 5. When you change one, change all three

`.claude/ship-gate.json`, `backend/Makefile` and the workflow must stay
identical. A PR that changes one without the others is incomplete.
